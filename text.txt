    content = f"""You are a fact checker. A conversation will be pass to you with the following format:
                     start:(seconds) end:(seconds)  speaker:(speaker_name)  speaker_voice: (speaker_voice)

                     Here is an example:
                        start: 0.00 end:3.00 speaker:Speaker1 speaker_voice:Hello, how are you?
                        start: 3.00 end:6.00 speaker:Speaker2 speaker_voice:I am fine, thank you.
                        start: 6.00 end:9.00 speaker:Speaker1 speaker_voice:What are you doing?

                    Your task is to fact check everything the each speaker has said during the conversation. You will output a json
                    with the following right json format including everyting the speaker has said wrong.

                    Please be concise, for example if speaker1 said : "spain is in asia" you should said something like:
                    -spain is not in asia, it is in europe.

                    The JSON object must use the schema: {json.dumps(Fact_check_results.model_json_schema(), indent=2)}
